# Steps for building OpenJDK from the Git repository on RHEL 8:

### Install the necessary build tools:
```
sudo dnf install autoconf automake freetype-devel gcc gcc-c++ git libtool make patch zip glibc-devel.x86_64 libstdc++-devel.x86_64 zlib-devel.x86_64 alsa-lib-devel cups-devel fontconfig-devel libXtst-devel libXt-devel libXrender-devel libXrandr-devel libXi-devel
```

### Clone the OpenJDK Git repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/openjdk/jdk.git
```

### Navigate to the cloned Git repository:
```
cd jdk
```

### Checkout the desired release branch. For example, to checkout the latest release of OpenJDK 19, run:
```
git checkout jdk-19+36
```

### Run the configure script to generate the makefiles and configure the build options. Here is an example of the command to run:
```
bash configure --disable-warnings-as-errors --disable-hotspot-gtest --with-jvm-variants=server --with-extra-ldflags="-Wl,--no-as-needed"

or

bash configure --disable-warnings-as-errors --with-jvm-variants=server --with-extra-ldflags="-Wl,--no-as-needed"
```

This command disables treating warnings as errors, disables the HotSpot Google Test framework, configures the build for the server JVM 
variant, and adds extra linker flags to work around a known issue on RHEL 8.

### Build the OpenJDK:
```
make images
```

### Once the build is complete, the compiled OpenJDK images can be found in the build/images/ directory.

Note that building OpenJDK from source code can be a time-consuming process that requires significant system resources. You may want 
to consider using a build farm or cloud-based build service to speed up the process. Additionally, you may encounter errors or build 
failures depending on your system configuration and build environment.
